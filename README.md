### TODO
1. Collect emails
2. Two menu items at the bottom "team work"
3. Open overlay on clicking them
4. If they try to close the website without entering their email, you need to show a dialog, make an offer and ask for their email... Maybe the offer can be a free 20 min consultation or something
